# Advent of Code
The Advent of Code is a yearly set of programming challenges that get released throughout the month of December, much like an advent calendar. I've participated in it since 2021.

## 2021
This was the first year I participated in AoC. My AP Java teacher introduced it to the class, and I was hooked. I was relatively slow, but overall I think it went well.

## 2022
Last year, I put a bit more priority into solving the daily challenges as fast as possible, starting them the time they released every day (9 PM PST). Looking at the results now, it seems like I had only a slight improvement in placements from 2021, but I suppose it's likely also skewed by the fact that more people participated in 2022. I think I ended up having to look up solutions (at least partially) for some of the days.

## 2023
This is the current year, and as of writing it's currently happening. Already, I've improved my placements by a lot. I won't upload my code until the event is done, but I will upload a picture of my current times. Something that's really worked well this year is using a template that lets me avoid the headache of writing similar code for each day and also streamlines the process of coding by splitting up the two parts each day into two separate functions.
