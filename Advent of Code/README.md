# Advent of Code
The Advent of Code is a yearly set of programming challenges that get released throughout the month of December, much like an advent calendar. I've participated in it since 2021.

## 2021
This was the first year I participated in AoC. My AP Java teacher introduced it to the class, and I was hooked. I was relatively slow, but overall I think it went well.

## 2022
Last year, I put a bit more priority into solving the daily challenges as fast as possible, starting them the time they released every day (9 PM PST). Looking at the results now, it seems like I had only a slight improvement in placements from 2021, but I suppose it's likely also skewed by the fact that more people participated in 2022. I think I ended up having to look up solutions (at least partially) for some of the days.

## 2023
This is the most recent AoC I participated in. A lot of things went right. I created a template that let me read the input data much faster, which helped me focus on the problems rather than annoying, repetitive code writing. I also placed higher than in previous years, getting into the top 1000 about 10 times for both parts 1 and 2; there was also never a day where I couldn't solve the problem either in the evening it released or the morning thereafter, which is something that happened a couple of times the years before.
