# Boggle Words
This was a short project I did in response to my friends and I playing a variant of Boggle on Discord (called Spell Cast, I think?). It pretty much just brute force searches every possible placement path until there are no more possible words that could come of it and then prints the highest scoring words. Because the game also had special powerups, I implemented the ability to replace a number of letters with wildcards, but this turned out to have an extremely high time complexity (i.e. exponential), so it doesn't run well beyond 2 wildcards.

Overall, it was a nice little thing that helped me explore time complexities. I think I ended up confirming that its overall time complexity was something like O(N^2 * M * k^W), where N=board length, M=size of your dictionary, and W=the number of wildcards you have.
