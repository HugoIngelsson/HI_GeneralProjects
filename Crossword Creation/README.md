# Crossword Creation
This was a project I made that takes an input "seed" (example in 'data/tofill.txt'), fills it with random letters, and then progressively shapes it into a valid crossword. I coded it after an AP Stats project, where my group and I collected data from NYT Daily Crosswords; I had this mass of clue/answer pairs and thought I ought to do something with it.
