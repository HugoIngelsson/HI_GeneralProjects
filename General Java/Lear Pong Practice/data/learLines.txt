11 LEAR~Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,/Gloucester.
11 LEAR~Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.--/Give me the map there.	/Know that we have divided/In three our kingdom, and 'tis our fast intent/To shake all cares and business from our age,/Conferring them on younger strengths, while we/Unburdened crawl toward death. Our son of/Cornwall/And you, our no less loving son of Albany,/We have this hour a constant will to publish/Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife/May be prevented now./The two great princes, France and Burgundy,/Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,/Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn/And here are to be answered. Tell me, my/daughters--/Since now we will divest us both of rule,/Interest of territory, cares of state--/Which of you shall we say doth love us most,/That we our largest bounty may extend/Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,/Our eldest born, speak first.
11 LEAR~/Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,/With shadowy forests and with champains riched,/With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,/We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue/Be this perpetual.--What says our second/daughter,/Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.
11 LEAR~To thee and thine hereditary ever/Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,/No less in space, validity, and pleasure/Than that conferred on Goneril.--Now, our joy,/Although our last and least, to whose young love/The vines of France and milk of Burgundy/Strive to be interessed, what can you say to draw/A third more opulent than your sisters'? Speak.
11 LEAR~Nothing?
11 LEAR~Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again.
11 LEAR~How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,/Lest you may mar your fortunes.
11 LEAR~But goes thy heart with this?
11 LEAR~So young and so untender?
11 LEAR~Let it be so. Thy truth, then, be thy dower,/For by the sacred radiance of the sun,/The mysteries of Hecate and the night,/By all the operation of the orbs/From whom we do exist and cease to be,/Here I disclaim all my paternal care,/Propinquity, and property of blood,/And as a stranger to my heart and me/Hold thee from this forever. The barbarous/Scythian,/Or he that makes his generation messes/To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom/Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved/As thou my sometime daughter.
11 LEAR~Peace, Kent./Come not between the dragon and his wrath./I loved her most and thought to set my rest/On her kind nursery. Hence and avoid/my sight!--/So be my grave my peace as here I give/Her father's heart from her.--Call France. Who stirs?/Call Burgundy. Cornwall and/Albany,/With my two daughters' dowers digest the third./Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her./I do invest you jointly with my power,/Preeminence, and all the large effects/That troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,/With reservation of an hundred knights/By you to be sustained, shall our abode/Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain/The name and all th' addition to a king./The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,/Beloved sons, be yours, which to confirm,/This coronet part between you.
11 LEAR~The bow is bent and drawn. Make from the shaft.
11 LEAR~Kent, on thy life, no more.
11 LEAR~Out of my sight!
11 LEAR~Now, by Apollo--
11 LEAR~O vassal! Miscreant!
11 LEAR~Hear me, recreant; on thine allegiance, hear me!/That thou hast sought to make us break our vows--/Which we durst never yet--and with strained pride/To come betwixt our sentence and our power,/Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,/Our potency made good, take thy reward:/Five days we do allot thee for provision/To shield thee from disasters of the world,/And on the sixth to turn thy hated back/Upon our kingdom. If on the tenth day following/Thy banished trunk be found in our dominions,/The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,/This shall not be revoked.
11 LEAR~My lord of Burgundy,/We first address toward you, who with this king/Hath rivaled for our daughter. What in the least/Will you require in present dower with her,/Or cease your quest of love?
11 LEAR~Right noble Burgundy,/When she was dear to us, we did hold her so,/But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands./If aught within that little seeming substance,/Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced/And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,/She's there, and she is yours.
11 LEAR~Will you, with those infirmities she owes,/Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,/Dowered with our curse and strangered with our/oath,/Take her or leave her?
11 LEAR~Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me/I tell you all her wealth.--For you, great king,/I would not from your love make such a stray/To match you where I hate. Therefore beseech you/T' avert your liking a more worthier way/Than on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed/Almost t' acknowledge hers.
11 LEAR~Better thou/Hadst not been born than not t' have pleased me/better.
11 LEAR~Nothing. I have sworn. I am firm.
11 LEAR~Thou hast her, France. Let her be thine, for we/Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see/That face of hers again. Therefore/begone/Without our grace, our love, our benison.--/Come, noble Burgundy.
14 LEAR~Let me not stay a jot for dinner. Go get it ready./How now, what art thou?
14 LEAR~What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with/us?
14 LEAR~What art thou?
14 LEAR~If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a/king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
14 LEAR~Who wouldst thou serve?
14 LEAR~Dost thou know me, fellow?
14 LEAR~What's that?
14 LEAR~What services canst do?
14 LEAR~How old art thou?
14 LEAR~Follow me. Thou shalt serve me--if I like thee/no worse after dinner. I will not part from thee/yet.--Dinner, ho, dinner!--Where's my knave, my/Fool? Go you and call my Fool hither.//You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?
14 LEAR~What says the fellow there? Call the clotpole/back. Where's my Fool? Ho! I think/the world's asleep./How now? Where's that mongrel?
14 LEAR~Why came not the slave back to me when I/called him?
14 LEAR~He would not?
14 LEAR~Ha? Sayst thou so?
14 LEAR~Thou but remembrest me of mine own conception./I have perceived a most faint neglect of late,/which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous/curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of/unkindness. I will look further into 't. But where's/my Fool? I have not seen him this two days.
14 LEAR~No more of that. I have noted it well.--Go you/and tell my daughter I would speak with her. Go you call hither my Fool.//O you, sir, you, come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?
14 LEAR~"My lady's father"? My lord's knave! You whoreson/dog, you slave, you cur!
14 LEAR~Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
14 LEAR~I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll/love thee.
14 LEAR~Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's/earnest of thy service.	
14 LEAR~How now, my pretty knave, how dost thou?
14 LEAR~Why, my boy?
14 LEAR~Why, my boy?
14 LEAR~Take heed, sirrah--the whip.
14 LEAR~A pestilent gall to me!
14 LEAR~Do.
14 LEAR~Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of/nothing.
14 LEAR~A bitter Fool!
14 LEAR~No, lad, teach me.
14 LEAR~Dost thou call me "fool," boy?
14 LEAR~What two crowns shall they be?
14 LEAR~When were you wont to be so full of songs,/sirrah?
14 LEAR~An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.
14 LEAR~How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on?/Methinks you are too much of late i' th' frown.
14 LEAR~Are you our daughter?
14 LEAR~Does any here know me? This is not Lear./Does Lear walk thus, speak thus? Where are his/eyes?/Either his notion weakens, his discernings/Are lethargied--Ha! Waking? 'Tis not so./Who is it that can tell me who I am?
14 LEAR~I would learn that, for, by the marks of/sovereignty,/Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded/I had daughters.
14 LEAR~Your name, fair gentlewoman?
14 LEAR~Darkness and/devils!--/Saddle my horses. Call my train together./Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee./Yet have I left a daughter.
14 LEAR~Woe that too late repents!--O, sir, are you/come?/Is it your will? Speak, sir.--Prepare my horses./Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,/More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child/Than the sea monster!
14 LEAR~ Detested kite, thou liest./My train are men of choice and rarest parts,/That all particulars of duty know/And in the most exact regard support/The worships of their name. O most small fault,/How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show,/Which, like an engine, wrenched my frame of/nature/From the fixed place, drew from my heart all love/And added to the gall! O Lear, Lear, Lear!/Beat at this gate that let thy folly in/And thy dear judgment out. Go, go, my people.
14 LEAR~It may be so, my lord.--/Hear, Nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!/Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend/To make this creature fruitful./Into her womb convey sterility./Dry up in her the organs of increase,/And from her derogate body never spring/A babe to honor her. If she must teem,/Create her child of spleen, that it may live/And be a thwart disnatured torment to her./Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,/With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,/Turn all her mother's pains and benefits/To laughter and contempt, that she may feel/How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is/To have a thankless child.--Away, away!
14 LEAR~What, fifty of my followers at a clap?/Within a fortnight?
14 LEAR~I'll tell thee. Life and death! I am/ashamed/That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus,/That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,/Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon/thee!/Th' untented woundings of a father's curse/Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,/Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck you out/And cast you, with the waters that you loose,/To temper clay. Yea, is 't come to this?/Ha! Let it be so. I have another daughter/Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable./When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails/She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find/That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think/I have cast off forever.	
15 LEAR~ Go you before to Gloucester with these/letters. Acquaint my daughter no further with anything/you know than comes from her demand out of/the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be/there afore you.
15 LEAR~Ay, boy.
15 LEAR~Ha, ha, ha!
15 LEAR~What canst tell, boy?
15 LEAR~No.
15 LEAR~I did her wrong.
15 LEAR~No.
15 LEAR~Why?
15 LEAR~I will forget my nature. So kind a father!--Be/my horses ready?	
15 LEAR~Because they are not eight.
15 LEAR~To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
15 LEAR~How's that?
15 LEAR~O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!/Keep me in temper. I would not be mad!/How now, are the horses ready?
15 LEAR~Come, boy.
24 LEAR~'Tis strange that they should so depart from home/And not send back my messenger.
24 LEAR~Ha?/Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?
24 LEAR~What's he that hath so much thy place mistook/To set thee here?
24 LEAR~No.
24 LEAR~No, I say.
24 LEAR~By Jupiter, I swear no.
24 LEAR~They durst not do 't./They could not, would not do 't. 'Tis worse than/murder/To do upon respect such violent outrage./Resolve me with all modest haste which way/Thou might'st deserve or they impose this usage,/Coming from us.
24 LEAR~O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!/Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow!/Thy element's below.--Where is this daughter?
24 LEAR~ Follow me not. Stay/here.	
24 LEAR~Deny to speak with me? They are sick? They are/weary?/They have traveled all the night? Mere fetches,/The images of revolt and flying off./Fetch me a better answer.
24 LEAR~Vengeance, plague, death, confusion!/"Fiery"? What "quality"? Why Gloucester,/Gloucester,/I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
24 LEAR~"Informed them"? Dost thou understand me,/man?
24 LEAR~The King would speak with Cornwall. The dear/father/Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends/service./Are they "informed" of this? My breath and/blood!/"Fiery"? The "fiery" duke? Tell the hot duke that--/No, but not yet. Maybe he is not well./Infirmity doth still neglect all office/Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves/When nature, being oppressed, commands the mind/To suffer with the body. I'll forbear,/And am fallen out with my more headier will,/To take the indisposed and sickly fit/For the sound man. Death on/my state! Wherefore/Should he sit here? This act persuades me/That this remotion of the Duke and her/Is practice only. Give me my servant forth./Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'd speak with them./Now, presently, bid them come forth and hear me,/Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum/Till it cry sleep to death.
24 LEAR~O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!
24 LEAR~Good morrow to you both.
24 LEAR~Regan, I think you are. I know what reason/I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,/I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,/Sepulch'ring an adult'ress. O, are you/free?/Some other time for that.--Beloved Regan,/Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied/Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here./I can scarce speak to thee. Thou 'lt not believe/With how depraved a quality--O Regan!
24 LEAR~Say? How is that?
24 LEAR~My curses on her.
24 LEAR~Ask her forgiveness?/Do you but mark how this becomes the house:/"Dear daughter, I confess that I am old./Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg/That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food."
24 LEAR~ Never, Regan./She hath abated me of half my train,/Looked black upon me, struck me with her tongue/Most serpentlike upon the very heart./All the stored vengeances of heaven fall/On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,/You taking airs, with lameness!
24 LEAR~You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames/Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,/You fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun/To fall and blister!
24 LEAR~No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse./Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give/Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but/thine/Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee/To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,/To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,/And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt/Against my coming in. Thou better know'st/The offices of nature, bond of childhood,/Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude./Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,/Wherein I thee endowed.
24 LEAR~Who put my man i' th' stocks?
24 LEAR~This is a slave whose easy-borrowed pride/Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.--/Out, varlet, from my sight!
24 LEAR~Who stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope/Thou didst not know on 't./Who comes here? O heavens,/If you do love old men, if your sweet sway/Allow obedience, if you yourselves are old,/Make it your cause. Send down and take my part./ Art not ashamed to look upon this/beard?	/O Regan, will you take her by the hand?
24 LEAR~O sides, you are too tough!/Will you yet hold?--How came my man i' th'/stocks?
24 LEAR~You? Did you?
24 LEAR~Return to her? And fifty men dismissed?/No! Rather I abjure all roofs, and choose/To wage against the enmity o' th' air,/To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,/Necessity's sharp pinch. Return with her?/Why the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took/Our youngest born--I could as well be brought/To knee his throne and, squire-like, pension beg/To keep base life afoot. Return with her?/Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter/To this detested groom.	
24 LEAR~I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad./I will not trouble thee, my child. Farewell./We'll no more meet, no more see one another./But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter,/Or, rather, a disease that's in my flesh,/Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,/A plague-sore or embossed carbuncle/In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee./Let shame come when it will; I do not call it./I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,/Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove./Mend when thou canst. Be better at thy leisure./I can be patient. I can stay with Regan,/I and my hundred knights.
24 LEAR~Is this well spoken?
24 LEAR~I gave you all--
24 LEAR~Made you my guardians, my depositaries,/But kept a reservation to be followed/With such a number. What, must I come to you/With five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?
24 LEAR~Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favored/When others are more wicked. Not being the worst/Stands in some rank of praise. I'll go/with thee./Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,/And thou art twice her love.
24 LEAR~O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars/Are in the poorest thing superfluous./Allow not nature more than nature needs,/Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady;/If only to go warm were gorgeous,/Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,/Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true/need--/You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!/You see me here, you gods, a poor old man/As full of grief as age, wretched in both./If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts/Against their father, fool me not so much/To bear it tamely. Touch me with noble anger,/And let not women's weapons, water drops,/Stain my man's cheeks.--No, you unnatural hags,/I will have such revenges on you both/That all the world shall--I will do such things--/What they are yet I know not, but they shall be/The terrors of the Earth! You think I'll weep./No, I'll not weep./I have full cause of weeping, but this heart/Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws/Or ere I'll weep.--O Fool, I shall go mad!
32 LEAR~Blow winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!/You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout/Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the/cocks./You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,/Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,/Singe my white head. And thou, all-shaking/thunder,/Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world./Crack nature's molds, all germens spill at once/That makes ingrateful man.
32 LEAR~Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain!/Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters./I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness./I never gave you kingdom, called you children;/You owe me no subscription. Then let fall/Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,/A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man./But yet I call you servile ministers,/That will with two pernicious daughters join/Your high-engendered battles 'gainst a head/So old and white as this. O, ho, 'tis foul!
32 LEAR~No, I will be the pattern of all patience./I will say nothing.
32 LEAR~Let the great gods/That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads/Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,/That hast within thee undivulged crimes/Unwhipped of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand,/Thou perjured, and thou simular of virtue/That art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake,/That under covert and convenient seeming/Has practiced on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,/Rive your concealing continents and cry/These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man/More sinned against than sinning.
32 LEAR~My wits begin to turn.--/Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?/I am cold myself.--Where is this straw, my fellow?/The art of our necessities is strange/And can make vile things precious. Come, your/hovel.--/Poor Fool and knave, I have one part in my heart/That's sorry yet for thee.
32 LEAR~True, my good boy.--Come, bring us to this hovel.
34 LEAR~Let me alone.
34 LEAR~Wilt break my heart?
34 LEAR~Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm/Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee./But where the greater malady is fixed,/The lesser is scarce felt. Thou 'dst shun a bear,/But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,/Thou 'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the/mind's free,/The body's delicate. This tempest in my mind/Doth from my senses take all feeling else/Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!/Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand/For lifting food to 't? But I will punish home./No, I will weep no more. In such a night/To shut me out? Pour on. I will endure./In such a night as this? O Regan, Goneril,/Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all!/O, that way madness lies. Let me shun that;/No more of that.
34 LEAR~Prithee, go in thyself. Seek thine own ease./This tempest will not give me leave to ponder/On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.--/In, boy; go first.--You houseless poverty--/Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep./Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,/That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,/How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,/Your looped and windowed raggedness defend/you/From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en/Too little care of this. Take physic, pomp./Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,/That thou may'st shake the superflux to them/And show the heavens more just.
34 LEAR~Didst thou give all to thy daughters? And art thou/come to this?
34 LEAR~Has his daughters brought him to this pass?--/Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst thou give 'em/all?
34 LEAR~Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air/Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
34 LEAR~Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature/To such a lowness but his unkind daughters./Is it the fashion that discarded fathers/Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?/Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot/Those pelican daughters.
34 LEAR~What hast thou been?
34 LEAR~Thou wert better in a grave than to answer with/thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.--Is/man no more than this? Consider him well.--Thou/ow'st the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep/no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha, here's three on 's/are sophisticated. Thou art the thing itself; unaccommodated/man is no more but such a poor, bare,/forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!/Come, unbutton here.	
34 LEAR~What's he?
34 LEAR~First let me talk with this philosopher./ What is the cause of thunder?
34 LEAR~I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.--/What is your study?
34 LEAR~Let me ask you one word in private.
34 LEAR~O, cry you mercy, sir./ Noble philosopher, your company.
34 LEAR~me, let's in all.
34 LEAR~ With him./I will keep still with my philosopher.
34 LEAR~Come, good Athenian.
36 LEAR~A king, a king!
36 LEAR~To have a thousand with red burning spits/Come hissing in upon 'em!
36 LEAR~It shall be done. I will arraign them straight./ Come, sit thou here, most learned/justice./ Thou sapient sir, sit here. Now, you/she-foxes--
36 LEAR~I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence./ Thou robed man of justice, take thy/place,/ And thou, his yokefellow of equity,/Bench by his side. You are o' th'/commission;/Sit you, too.
36 LEAR~Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my oath/before this honorable assembly, kicked the poor/king her father.
36 LEAR~She cannot deny it.
36 LEAR~And here's another whose warped looks proclaim/What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!/Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!/False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?
36 LEAR~The little dogs and all,/Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.
36 LEAR~Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds/about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that/make these hard hearts? You, sir, I/entertain for one of my hundred; only I do not like/the fashion of your garments. You will say they are/Persian, but let them be changed.
36 LEAR~ Make no noise, make no noise./Draw the curtains. So, so, we'll go to supper i' th'/morning.
46 LEAR~No, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the/King himself.
46 LEAR~Nature's above art in that respect. There's your/press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a/crowkeeper. Draw me a clothier's yard. Look, look,/a mouse! Peace, peace! This piece of toasted cheese/will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it on a/giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!/I' th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.
46 LEAR~Pass.
46 LEAR~Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flattered/me like a dog and told me I had the white hairs in/my beard ere the black ones were there. To say "ay"/and "no" to everything that I said "ay" and "no" to/was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me/once and the wind to make me chatter, when the/thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I/found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to. They are/not men o' their words; they told me I was everything./'Tis a lie. I am not ague-proof.
46 LEAR~Ay, every inch a king./When I do stare, see how the subject quakes./I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?/Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No./The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly does/lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive, for/Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to his father/than my daughters got 'tween the lawful sheets. To/'t, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers. Behold yond/simp'ring dame, whose face between her forks/presages snow, that minces virtue and does shake/the head to hear of pleasure's name. The fitchew/nor the soiled horse goes to 't with a more riotous/appetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs,/though women all above. But to the girdle do the/gods inherit; beneath is all the fiend's. There's hell,/there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit; burning,/scalding, stench, consumption! Fie, fie, fie, pah,/pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary;/sweeten my imagination. There's money for thee.
46 LEAR~Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
46 LEAR~I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou/squinny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid, I'll/not love. Read thou this challenge. Mark but the/penning of it.
46 LEAR~Read.
46 LEAR~O ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your/head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in/a heavy case, your purse in a light, yet you see how/this world goes.
46 LEAR~What, art mad? A man may see how this world/goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how/yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in/thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy, which/is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a/farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
46 LEAR~And the creature run from the cur? There thou/might'st behold the great image of authority: a/dog's obeyed in office./Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!/Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back./Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind/For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the/cozener./Through tattered clothes small vices do appear./Robes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sin with/gold,/And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks./Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it./None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em./Take that of me, my friend, who have the power/To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes,/And like a scurvy politician/Seem to see the things thou dost not. Now, now,/now, now./Pull off my boots. Harder, harder. So.
46 LEAR~If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes./I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester./Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;/Thou know'st the first time that we smell the air/We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.
46 LEAR~When we are born, we cry that we are come/To this great stage of fools.--This' a good block./It were a delicate stratagem to shoe/A troop of horse with felt. I'll put 't in proof,/And when I have stol'n upon these son-in-laws,/Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
46 LEAR~No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even/The natural fool of Fortune. Use me well./You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;/I am cut to th' brains.
46 LEAR~No seconds? All myself?/Why, this would make a man a man of salt,/To use his eyes for garden waterpots,/Ay, and laying autumn's dust./I will die bravely like a smug bridegroom. What?/I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king,/Masters, know you that?
46 LEAR~Then there's life in 't. Come, an you get it, you/shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.
47 LEAR~You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave./Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound/Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears/Do scald like molten lead.
47 LEAR~You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die?
47 LEAR~Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?/I am mightily abused; I should e'en die with pity/To see another thus. I know not what to say./I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see./I feel this pinprick. Would I were assured/Of my condition!
47 LEAR~Pray do not mock:/I am a very foolish fond old man,/Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less,/And to deal plainly,/I fear I am not in my perfect mind./Methinks I should know you and know this man,/Yet I am doubtful, for I am mainly ignorant/What place this is, and all the skill I have/Remembers not these garments; nor I know not/Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me,/For, as I am a man, I think this lady/To be my child Cordelia.
47 LEAR~Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray, weep not./If you have poison for me, I will drink it./I know you do not love me, for your sisters/Have, as I do remember, done me wrong./You have some cause; they have not.
47 LEAR~Am I in France?
47 LEAR~Do not abuse me.
47 LEAR~You must bear with me./Pray you now, forget, and forgive. I am old and/foolish.	
53 LEAR~No, no, no, no. Come, let's away to prison./We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage./When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down/And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,/And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh/At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues/Talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too--/Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out--/And take upon 's the mystery of things,/As if we were God's spies. And we'll wear out,/In a walled prison, packs and sects of great ones/That ebb and flow by th' moon.
53 LEAR~Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,/The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught/thee?/He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven/And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes./The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell,/Ere they shall make us weep. We'll see 'em starved/first./Come.
53 LEAR~Howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones!/Had I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them so/That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone/forever./I know when one is dead and when one lives./She's dead as earth.--Lend me a looking glass./If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,/Why, then she lives.
53 LEAR~This feather stirs. She lives. If it be so,/It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows/That ever I have felt.
53 LEAR~Prithee, away.
53 LEAR~A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!/I might have saved her. Now she's gone forever.--/Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little. Ha!/What is 't thou sayst?--Her voice was ever soft,/Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman./I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.
53 LEAR~Did I not, fellow?/I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion/I would have made him skip. I am old now,/And these same crosses spoil me. Who/are you?/Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.
53 LEAR~This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
53 LEAR~He's a good fellow, I can tell you that./He'll strike and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.
53 LEAR~I'll see that straight.
53 LEAR~You are welcome/hither.
53 LEAR~Ay, so I think.
53 LEAR~And my poor fool is hanged. No, no, no life?/Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,/And thou no breath at all? Thou 'lt come no more,/Never, never, never, never, never.--/Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir./Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,/Look there, look there!
