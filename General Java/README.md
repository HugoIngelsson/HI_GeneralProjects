# General Java
This is a folder containing random, smaller projects I've made. I describe them all in this README file.

## Lear Pong Practice
This is a program that helped me practice for a game we played in my high school AP Lit class, called Lear Pong. I made a nice user interface that let you choose acts from King Lear and either complete quotes or attribute quotes to speakers. Included is also a helper file that reads the entirety of King Lear (taken from Folger's Library, if I'm not mistaken?) and puts it into a much more easily parsed data file.

## Prisoner's Dilemma
This was another project I made for an English class, only this time for AP Lang. Our teacher had told us that we'd have to make a final project revolving some topic we'd read about in The Better Angels of Our Nature, the book we were reading. I chose to make a simulator of the prisoner's dilemma, using interfaces to create different "actors" that would follow different strategies in several consecutive rounds of the prisoner's dilemma. We never ended up having to do the project because of a lack of time, so in a sense this was a wasted collection of code... that is, until today, when whoever is reading this gets to experience the joy of moral quandaries.
