## Lear Pong Practice
This is a program that helped me practice for a game we played in my high school AP Lit class, called Lear Pong. I made a nice user interface that let you choose acts from King Lear and either complete quotes or attribute quotes to speakers. Included is also a helper file that reads the entirety of King Lear (taken from Folger's Library, if I'm not mistaken?) and puts it into a much more easily parsed data file.
