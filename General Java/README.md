# General Java
This is a folder containing random, smaller projects I've made. I describe them all in this README file.

## Lear Pong Practice
This is a program that helped me practice for a game we played in my high school AP Lit class, called Lear Pong. I made a nice user interface that let you choose acts from King Lear and either complete quotes or attribute quotes to speakers. Included is also a helper file that reads the entirety of King Lear (taken from Folger's Library, if I'm not mistaken?) and puts it into a much more easily parsed data file.

## Prisoner's Dilemma
This was another project I made for an English class, only this time for AP Lang. Our teacher had told us that we'd have to make a final project revolving some topic we'd read about in The Better Angels of Our Nature, the book we were reading. I chose to make a simulator of the prisoner's dilemma, using interfaces to create different "actors" that would follow different strategies in several consecutive rounds of the prisoner's dilemma. We never ended up having to do the project because of a lack of time, so in a sense this was a wasted collection of code... that is, until today, when whoever is reading this gets to experience the joy of moral quandaries.

## Calculator
In short, this is effectively a glorified String parser. It reads a user input math equation, which can contain the standard operations (i.e. +, -, *, /, and ^), parantheses for order of operations, e and pi, and some specific math functions (i.e. cos, sin, log, ...). Looking back at it, it's not super complicated, but I thought it was interesting at the time I made it.

## Determinants
This just calculates the determinant of a square matrix. YEP! That's it. I suppose I probably wrote this after having learned the definition of a higher dimension determinant and thought the recursive logic behind it was interesting.

## Quizlet Shuffler
I made this to shuffle a set of quizlet flashcards when compiling the complete set of chapter terms for my APUSH class right before the AP test. For some reason, Quizlet doesn't have a shuffle functionality (at least not when I used it; does it now?), and without shuffling you'd be able to tell from what unit each term would be, so I did this to help my studying ability.

## Radix Sorter
This is another one-off algorithm, that, like with the determinant calculator, I likely implemented just because I'd heard of it and thought it sounded cool. (For reference, the radix sort algorithm sorts a set of numerical data in O(n) time)
