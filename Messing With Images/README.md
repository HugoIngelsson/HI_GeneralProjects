# Messing With Images
This was sort of a random project I came up with. I wanted to explore edge detection in images, so I implemented the canny algorithm using
BufferedReaders. I then took some time to optimize processing times (including making effectively the same script in C++, which I don't have
included here), but ultimately it's still much slower than just implementing some library that does this for you.
