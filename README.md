# Hugo Ingelsson General Projects
A repository of many of my projects.

Each project folder has a README file that gives a description of what the project is all about.

This is the order of projects I recommend you visit:
 1. Crossword Creation: I think this is the most useful thing I've created, and it's pretty interesting
 2. Scrabble: This isn't as useful, but it's got some interesting data structures and I wrote a lot about it :)
 3. ChessBots: I spent a lot of time working on this, and it has a couple of interesting algorithms if you're interested in chess computers

After that, I might take a look at General Java because it's got some short and sweet descriptions of a lot of programs. The rest of the things I made are fairly short, so take a look at them if you want, but know they're not super complicated.
